AI-Powered Developer Portfolio:<br>
Welcome to my latest portfolio project—a professionally designed and meticulously customized developer portfolio built using Lovable, an AI-powered website builder. This repository showcases not only modern web development skills but also my commitment to leveraging innovative AI technology combined with hands-on craftsmanship to deliver a polished, scalable, and user-centric experience.

Project Overview:<br>
This portfolio represents an evolution in my development journey. While my previous portfolio was fully hand-coded with inspirations from premier design platforms like Figma, Dribbble, Medium, and ThemeForest, this latest project embraces cutting-edge AI-driven development without compromising on quality or creativity.
Starting with Lovable’s AI-generated foundation, I brought the project into a local development environment where I extensively customized and optimized every section. The result is a seamless fusion of AI efficiency and developer expertise, delivering a robust, performant, and visually compelling portfolio reflective of my professional brand.
